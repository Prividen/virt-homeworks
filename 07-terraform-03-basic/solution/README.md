# Домашняя работа по занятию "7.3. Основы и принцип работы Терраформ"

> Задача 1. Создадим бэкэнд в S3 (необязательно, но крайне желательно).

```
$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "s3"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.
```

---
> Задача 2. Инициализируем проект и создаем воркспейсы. 

> 1. В уже созданный `aws_instance` добавьте зависимость типа инстанса от вокспейса, что бы в разных ворскспейсах 
использовались разные `instance_type`.
> 1. Добавим `count`. Для `stage` должен создаться один экземпляр `ec2`, а для `prod` два. 
> 1. Создайте рядом еще один `aws_instance`, но теперь определите их количество при помощи `for_each`, а не `count`.
> 1. Что бы при изменении типа инстанса не возникло ситуации, когда не будет ни одного инстанса добавьте параметр
жизненного цикла `create_before_destroy = true` в один из рессурсов `aws_instance`.
> 1. При желании поэкспериментируйте с другими параметрами и рессурсами.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
